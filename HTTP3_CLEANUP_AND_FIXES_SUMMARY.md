# HTTP3 Files Cleanup and Testing Fixes - Summary

## 🧹 HTTP3 Files Consolidation

### Issues Identified and Fixed:

#### 1. **Empty and Duplicate Files Removed**
- ❌ `http3_helper.go` - Empty file removed
- ❌ `http3_optimized.go` - Empty file removed  
- ❌ `http3.go.backup` - Backup file removed
- ❌ `http3_methods.go` - Contained duplicate code, merged into main file and removed

#### 2. **Single Responsibility Achieved**
- ✅ `http3.go` - Now contains all HTTP/3 functionality in one consolidated file
- ✅ 839 lines of production-ready HTTP/3 implementation with QUIC support
- ✅ Comprehensive connection management, statistics, and monitoring

#### 3. **Compilation Errors Fixed**
- ✅ Removed `expected 'package', found 'EOF'` errors from empty files
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate function declarations
- ✅ Clean compilation with `go build ./...`

## 🧪 Load Balancing Algorithm Tests Fixed

### Critical Issues Resolved:

#### 1. **Health Filtering Missing**
**Problem**: Load balancing strategies were not filtering out unhealthy backends
- Round Robin Strategy was selecting from all backends regardless of health
- Weighted Round Robin Strategy ignored backend health status
- Least Connections Strategy included unhealthy backends
- IP Hash Strategy didn't check backend health

**Solution**: Added health filtering to all strategies in `/internal/service/load_balancer.go`:

```go
// Filter out unhealthy backends
healthyBackends := make([]*domain.Backend, 0, len(backends))
for _, backend := range backends {
    if backend.IsHealthy() {
        healthyBackends = append(healthyBackends, backend)
    }
}

if len(healthyBackends) == 0 {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("no healthy backends available")
}
```

#### 2. **Test Failures Resolved**
- ✅ `TestStrategiesWithUnhealthyBackends` - Now correctly filters unhealthy backends
- ✅ `TestNoAvailableBackendsScenarios` - Properly returns errors when no healthy backends
- ✅ `TestStrategiesConcurrency` - All backends now receive requests under concurrent load

#### 3. **Algorithm Consistency**
All four strategies now consistently:
- Filter out unhealthy backends first
- Return appropriate errors when no healthy backends available
- Maintain their respective selection logic (round-robin, weighted, least-conn, ip-hash)

## 🚀 Project Status Verification
